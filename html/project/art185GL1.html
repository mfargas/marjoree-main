            <h2>Key Takeaways</h2>
            <p>This project was developed throughout the course of Art 185GL Spring 2018. Our Arduino Machine Learning project
                demonstrated a scavenger hunt simulated by a robot and the process for a machine to recognize items using
                Object Detection.
            </p>
            <br>
            <h2>Process</h2>
            <p>
                We intended on having our arduino unit recognize an object, move towards it and take a picture to “collect” it as a
                completed task on the scavenger hunt. In order to complete the hunt, the robot must be able to recognize each object
                from different angles as it moves around the room. We created a list of objects for it to seek and complete to
                demonstrate an understanding of its task and ability to execute it.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                We intended on teaching the Raspberry Pi how to detect the objects through a machine learning tutorial and collaborate
                with the Arduino’s robotic movement code to create a system of moving, searching, and identifying. This is to mimic
                mannerisms of a child learning to identify an object and actively seek them out as though it were a scavenger hunt. We
                additionally aimed to design a set and costume for the robot to enhance this effect.
            </p>

                Machine Learning is an interesting topic of technology we are happy to have experimented with. While, from the start of
                the rise of computers, the concept of an artificial intelligence takeover has remained prevailant within our society.
                It's shown in TV and movies, constantly depicting the rise of robots or our technology turning against us. To personally
                see the rate of growth with machine learning, Kara and I understand the lengths deep learning would need to take in
                order to go against its own programmer. 
            </p>

            <p>                
                To teach our Arduino unit how to detect an orange, we needed to reinforce the
                visual learnings through an intense amount of images for the Arduino to collect. After studying and comparing images,
                the robot learns to associate that object with these images using the Nanonets API in communication with the PiCamera.
                For future experiments, it would be interesting to incorporate the use of touch, smell, taste, and perhaps sound. This
                experiment primarily forcused on the robots ability to visually detect an object after creating learning models based on
                collections of images of these objects.
